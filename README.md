# Predict Bike Sharing Patterns using Neural Networks

This is the first project completed as part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree. This project can help predict daily bike rental ridership based on data obtained from UCI Machine Learning Database.

This project implements a foundational neural network with multiple input layers, multiple hidden layers and a single output layer. The concepts of gradient descent, backpropogation and forward pass were used to train this neural network to predict as closely as possible to the actual output.

This project really helped cement the basics. For more information, checkout the Deep Learning Nanodegree on [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees)
